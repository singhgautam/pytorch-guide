    "1. Data for each time-step will be processed one after the other by the same model-cell. Model-cell here refers to any generic neural network cell that processes data for one time-step such as a simple LSTM cell or something more complicated like a NTM cell. We typically want to call the model-cell in a loop for input tensors of every time step. This loop is the outer-most artifact in the code-organisation and hence time-step should be the 0th dimension of the input data tensor.\n",
    "2. At a given time-step, when the model-cell is processing a sub-tensor, we'd like to have its 0th dimension as the dimension for the batch index and the 1st dimension as the dimension to index over entries of the input vector.\n",

Suppose you gave the input as a 3D tensor for just one time step as exemplified in the above Example 1. But after getting the output, you want to do other things with the output and the 3D output tensor having semantics *(sequence, batch, values)* seems a bit cumbersome because the *sequence* dimension is just size 1 since we are dealing with just one time step.
